1. Class and Obj (example)  

2. Class has data/attribute and func/methods
    > Code walkthrough
    > attributes get called itself,methods are called manually

3. Why Python is called OOP? - Everything in Python is an object (data structure, data type etc)

4. Advantages of OOPS:
    > You can create your own datatype
    > code reusability
    > debugging
    > easy to colab

5. End to End Project (Chatbook class)
    > function v/s method
    > magic method /  dunder method / special method
    > self
    > You can create attribute outside the class as well

    > encapsulation
    > getter and setter 
    > static method

6. Inheritance
    > Inheritance code example
    > Why Inheritance is needed (code reusability,parent has no access to child class)
    > What gets inherited? - Constructor, Non private attributes, Non private methods
    > Constructor overloading & Method Overloading
    > Super Keyword () - (can be used only inside class, can not access variables/attributes, used only inside child class )
